# Bluesky Verification Badge Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Bluesky verification badges in the Basker platform. Verified accounts now display a blue checkmark badge next to their display name, consistent with Bluesky's verification system.

## What is Bluesky Verification?
Bluesky uses several methods to indicate verified/trusted accounts:

1. **Domain Verification (Primary Method)**: The most common form of verification in Bluesky. Users can set their handle to a domain they own (e.g., `jay.bsky.team`, `pfrazee.com`). Any handle NOT ending in `.bsky.social` is considered domain-verified and will show a verification badge.

2. **Labeler Accounts**: Accounts that operate as official labelers have `associated.labeler === true`

3. **Special Labels**: Some accounts may have verification labels in their `labels` array

### Examples of Verified Accounts:
- `jay.bsky.team` (Bluesky team member) - Domain verified ✓
- `pfrazee.com` (Paul Frazee) - Domain verified ✓
- `bsky.app` (Official Bluesky account) - Domain verified ✓
- Any user with a custom domain handle - Domain verified ✓

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates (`shared/schema.ts`)
Added new optional fields to the `UserProfile` schema:
- `associated`: Object containing labeler status and other associated metadata
- `labels`: Array of profile labels that may include verification information
- `followersCount`, `followsCount`, `postsCount`, `createdAt`: Additional profile metadata

### 2. Verification Utility (`client/src/lib/verification-utils.ts`)
Created a new utility module with two functions:
- `isVerifiedAccount(profile)`: Checks if a profile is verified based on `associated.labeler` or verification labels
- `getVerificationTooltip(profile)`: Returns appropriate tooltip text for the verification badge

### 3. AT Protocol Client Updates (`client/src/lib/atprotocol.ts`)
Enhanced the `getPublicProfile()` method to:
- Log `associated` and `labels` data from Bluesky's API
- Ensure full profile data is passed through including verification information

### 4. Component Updates

#### ProfileHeader (`client/src/components/ProfileHeader.tsx`)
- Added imports for `Tooltip` component and `BadgeCheck` icon
- Imported verification utility functions
- Added verification badge display next to display name with tooltip
- Badge shows as a blue checkmark when user is verified

#### PublicProfileHeader (`client/src/components/PublicProfileHeader.tsx`)
- Same verification badge implementation as ProfileHeader
- Shows verification status for public profiles being viewed

#### WhoToFollow (`client/src/components/WhoToFollow.tsx`)
- Updated `SuggestedUser` interface to include `associated` and `labels` fields
- Added verification badge next to user names in the suggested users list
- Smaller badge size (w-4 h-4) appropriate for the compact layout

#### AuthContext (`client/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Updated login and session restoration to include `associated` and `labels` fields
- Ensures the authenticated user's verification status is captured and stored

#### PublicProfilePage (`client/src/pages/PublicProfilePage.tsx`)
- Updated to pass through `associated` and `labels` fields when creating UserProfile object
- Ensures verification data flows through to profile display components

## Visual Design

### Two Types of Verification Badges

**1. Trusted Verifier/Labeler Badge (7-scalloped)**
- Used for official organizations and trusted verifiers (`associated.labeler === true`)
- Features 7 scallops/points around the outer edge
- Tooltip: "Verified Organization"
- Examples: Official Bluesky accounts, trusted labeling services

**2. Regular Verified Badge (Simple Circle)**
- Used for domain-verified accounts (custom handles not ending in `.bsky.social`)
- Simple filled circle with checkmark
- Tooltip: "Verified via domain: [handle]"
- Examples: Any user with their own domain as their handle

### Badge Specifications
- **Color**: Blue (#3B82F6) with white checkmark
- **Size**: 
  - Main profiles: 20px
  - Suggested users: 16px
- **Custom SVG**: Hand-crafted to match Bluesky's official design

## Usage
The verification badge will automatically appear for:
1. Your own profile (if you're verified)
2. Any public profile you visit (if they're verified)
3. Users in the "Who to Follow" suggestions (if they're verified)

No manual configuration is needed - the system automatically detects verification status from Bluesky's API.

## Testing
To test verification badges:
1. Visit a verified Bluesky account's profile (e.g., official Bluesky accounts)
2. The blue checkmark should appear next to their display name
3. Hover over the checkmark to see the verification tooltip

## Future Enhancements
Possible improvements:
1. Add verification badges to starter pack member lists (requires fetching full profiles)
2. Add verification filter in user search
3. Display verification date/details in profile modals
4. Support for custom verification labels from community labelers
